      <description>As well as the occasional big blog post, I make many smaller FPGA discoveries and Project F updates each month. I thought it would be interesting to share a few of these in a monthly news post. What do you think? Let me know via @WillFlux or open an issue on GitHub.
Blog In May, I added two blog posts: Hello Arty Part 3 and FPGA Sine Lookup Table.
Hello Arty is my introductory series for the Digilent Arty board.</description>

      <description>I like to learn by doing, by trying things out and experimenting. However, this is hard with FPGAs; there’s a significant lack of practical Verilog designs online. The Project F Library is the latest part of my attempt to make things a little better for FPGA beginners and hackers. Over the last couple of years, I’ve built up a small collection of handy Verilog modules as part of this blog. The Library brings these modules together with documentation and test benches to make them more accessible.</description>
