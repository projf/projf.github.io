      <description>Project F news is your monthly update on the project, with tasty tips and links thrown in. Last month&amp;rsquo;s issue was well received, so I&amp;rsquo;m continuing with the experiment. June wasn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest of months, with a stint of COVID self-isolation1, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have written about Verilator and SDL. If you have any comments, find me on Twitter @WillFlux, or open an issue on GitHub.

      <description>As well as the occasional big blog post, I make many smaller FPGA discoveries and Project F updates each month. I thought it would be interesting to share a few of these in a monthly news post. What do you think? Let me know via @WillFlux or open an issue on GitHub.

Blog In May, I added two blog posts: Hello Arty Part 3 and FPGA Sine Lookup Table.</description>

      <title>Project F Verilog Library</title>

      <description>I like to learn by doing, by trying things out and experimenting. However, this is hard with FPGAs; there’s a significant lack of practical Verilog designs online. The Project F Library is the latest part of my attempt to make things a little better for FPGA beginners and hackers. Over the last couple of years, I’ve built up a small collection of handy Verilog modules as part of this blog. The Library brings these modules together with documentation and test benches to make them more accessible.</description>
