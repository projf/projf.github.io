      <description>I like to learn by doing, by trying things out and experimenting. However, this is hard with FPGAs; there’s a significant lack of practical Verilog designs online. The Project F Library is the latest part of my attempt to make things a little better for FPGA beginners and hackers. Over the last couple of years, I’ve built up a small collection of handy Verilog modules as part of this blog. The Library brings these modules together with documentation and test benches to make them more accessible.</description>
