This month&amp;rsquo;s new blog post covers multiplication with DSPs, plus there are loads of interesting links and an FPGA advent calendar. I&amp;rsquo;m also happy to report that the main Project F repo &lt;em>projf-explore&lt;/em> passed 200 stars on GitHub.</description></item><item><title>News: October 2021</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-10/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-10/</guid><description>Welcome to October&amp;rsquo;s update from Project F. This month, we build a rainbow from circles, learn more about numbers in Verilog, find a UART in the library, and hear about exciting FPGA projects from Ben Blundell and Rob Shelton.</description></item><item><title>News: September 2021</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-09/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-09/</guid><description>Project F news is your monthly bowl of FPGA goodness with tasty tips and links from other developers mixed in. This month I began a new series on &lt;em>Maths &amp;amp; Algorithms&lt;/em>, added a new rotation demo, and started a new blog on computing history. September also saw the release of Yosys 0.10 and the sad death of Sir Clive Sinclair.</description></item><item><title>News: August 2021</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-08/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-08/</guid><description>Project F news is your monthly bowl of FPGA goodness with tasty tips and links from other developers mixed in. August saw my first circle drawn, new graphics designs for iCEBreaker, improved build instructions, and the first draft of a new post covering animated graphics and double buffering.</description></item><item><title>News: July 2021</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-07/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-07/</guid><description>Project F news is your monthly update on the FPGA project, with tasty tips and links from other developers thrown in. This month, iCE40 SPRAM takes centre stage, filled triangles add graphical goodness, we learn that Linux will fit on an iCEBreaker, and discover FPGAs on Mars.</description></item><item><title>News: June 2021</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-06/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-06/</guid><description>Project F news is your monthly update on the project, with tasty tips and links thrown in. Last month&amp;rsquo;s issue was well received, so I&amp;rsquo;m continuing with the experiment. June wasn&amp;rsquo;t the easiest of months, with a stint of COVID self-isolation, but I&amp;rsquo;m happy to have written about Verilator and SDL.</description></item><item><title>News: May 2021</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-05/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/news-2021-05/</guid><description>As well as the occasional big blog post, I make many smaller FPGA discoveries and Project F updates each month. I thought it would be interesting to share a few of these in a monthly news post. What do you think?</description></item><item><title>Verilog Library Announcement</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-library-announcement/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-library-announcement/</guid><description>I like to learn by doing, by trying things out and experimenting. However, this is hard with FPGAs; thereâ€™s a significant lack of practical Verilog designs online. The Project F Library is the latest part of my attempt to make things a little better for FPGA hackers and beginners.</description></item></channel></rss>
