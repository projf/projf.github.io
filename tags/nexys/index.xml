      <description>Welcome back to our three-part FPGA tutorial with SystemVerilog and the Digilent Nexys Video. In part two, we&amp;rsquo;re going to learn about clocks and counting. Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover maintaining state with flip-flops, timing things with clock dividers, creating our first Verilog module, and controlling LEDs with pulse width modulation. This post is also available for the Arty. This post was last updated in December 2021.

      <description>This three-part tutorial provides a quick introduction to FPGA development with SystemVerilog and the Digilent Nexys Video board. No prior experience of FPGA development is required, but basic knowledge of programming concepts is assumed. If you can write a simple program with Python or JavaScript, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble. This post was last updated in June 2021.
I find working with FPGAs gives me a sense of delight so often lacking in modern software development.</description>
