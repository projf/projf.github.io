      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the previous two parts, we worked with sprites, but as graphics become more complex, a different approach is needed. Instead of drawing directly to the screen, we draw to a framebuffer, which is read by the display controller. This post provides an introduction to framebuffers and how to scale and fade them Wolfenstein 3D style. In the next part, we&amp;rsquo;ll use a framebuffer to visualize a simulation of life.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the previous part, we recreated Pong. In this part, we learn how to create colourful animated graphics with hardware sprites. Hardware sprites maintain much of the simplicity of our Pong design while offering much greater creative freedom. In the next part, we&amp;rsquo;ll create a demo that gives a taste of what&amp;rsquo;s possible with sprites.
In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In this post we&amp;rsquo;re going to use the designs we created in Framebuffers to experiment with Conway&amp;rsquo;s Game of Life.
In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the previous part, we got an introduction to FPGA graphics; now we&amp;rsquo;re ready to put our graphical skills to work recreating the arcade classic: Pong.

      <title>Video Timings: VGA, SVGA, 720p, 1080p</title>
      <link>https://projectf.io/posts/video-timings-vga-720p-1080p/</link>

      <description>To work with standard monitors and TVs, you need to use the correct video timings. This recipe includes the timings for four standard display modes using analogue VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort: 640x480 (VGA), 800x600 (SVGA), 1280x720, and 1920x1080 all at 60 Hz.
CRT monitors typically support higher refresh rates in addition to 60 Hz, such as 72 and 85 Hz, but most LCD monitors do not. There are an increasing number of televisions and monitors that do support high refresh rates, but these are beyond the scope of this guide.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the previous part we learnt how to create hardware sprites. In this fourth part, we create a demo by combining our knowledge of sprites with animated starfields.
In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models.</description>

      <description>Welcome to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In this series, we explore graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We start by learning how displays work, before racing the beam with Pong, starfields and sprites, simulating life with bitmaps, drawing lines and triangles, and finally creating simple 3D models. I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing and revising this series throughout 2020.
In this first post, we learn how computer displays work and animate simple shapes with an FPGA.</description>
