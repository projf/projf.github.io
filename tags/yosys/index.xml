In this post, I provide a quick guide to building an open-source FPGA toolchain for iCE40 boards, such as iCEBreaker. I plan to cover ECP5 FPGAs in a future version.
This guide is designed for Ubuntu or Pop!_OS 20.04, but should be straightforward to adjust to your own distro. These instructions will work on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), but there&amp;rsquo;s no USB support in WSL, so you can&amp;rsquo;t program boards under WSL.</description></item><item><title>FPGA Tooling on Ubuntu 20.04</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-dev-ubuntu-20.04/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-dev-ubuntu-20.04/</guid><description>In this post, I test common FPGA tools for compatibility with Ubuntu 20.04 (AKA Focal Fossa), and my regular desktop OS: Pop!_OS 20.04. These tests are in no way exhaustive: I have tried using the applications as I usually do to exercise the main functionality. I have also included instructions for building the tools from source when available. This is my final update for this post (July 2020).
Tested: IceStorm Tools, nextpnr, nMigen, Verilator, Vivado, Yosys Incomplete: Quartus Share your thoughts with @WillFlux on Mastodon or Twitter.</description></item></channel></rss>
