These instructions are included in RV32I, the base integer instruction set. New to the series? Check out the first part on arithmetic instructions.
In the last few years, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen an explosion of RISC-V CPU designs, especially on FPGA. Thankfully, RISC-V is ideal for assembly programming with its compact, easy-to-learn instruction set. This mini-series will help you learn and understand 32-bit RISC-V instructions (RV32) and the RISC-V ABI.</description></item><item><title>RISC-V Assembler: Logical</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/riscv-logical/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/riscv-logical/</guid><description>In this post we look at RISC-V logical instructions, such as and and xori.

In the last few years, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen an explosion of RISC-V CPU designs, especially on FPGA. Thankfully, RISC-V is ideal for assembly programming with its compact, easy-to-learn instruction set. This mini-series will help you learn and understand 32-bit RISC-V instructions (RV32) and the RISC-V ABI. The first part looks at load immediate, addition, and subtraction. We&amp;rsquo;ll also cover sign extension and pseudoinstructions.</description></item></channel></rss>
