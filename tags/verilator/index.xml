I created this effect with benjamin.computer for All You Need, a Chapterhouse prod released at Revision 2022.
For an introduction to rasterbars and other simple graphics effects, check out Racing the Beam.
The design was originally for a custom Artix-7 dev board, but this version runs on the Digilent Arty A7 or as a Verilator/SDL simulation on your computer.

We don&amp;rsquo;t use any software or CPU, just shape rasterization and finite state machines. As our FPGA graphics capabilities improve, I&amp;rsquo;ll add more features to this drawing. Stay tuned.

Last time, we got introduction to FPGA graphics; now, we&amp;rsquo;re ready to put our graphical skills to work with some simple demo effects. I hope these examples inspire you to create your own effects and improve your hardware design skills.
In this series, we learn about graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn how screens work, play Pong, create starfields and sprites, paint Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s David, draw lines and triangles, and animate characters and shapes.</description></item><item><title>Animated Shapes</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/animated-shapes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/animated-shapes/</guid><description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the final part of our introductory graphics series, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at animation. We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen animation with hardware sprites, but double buffering gives us maximum creative freedom with fast, tear-free motion. We&amp;rsquo;ll be making extensive use of our designs from 2D Shapes, so have a look back at that post if you need a refresher on drawing shapes.

You can perform low-level behavioural simulations and examine waveforms, but you also need to verify how the video output will appear on the screen.
By combining Verilator and SDL, you can build Verilog simulations that let you see your design on your computer. The thought of creating a graphical simulation can be intimidating, but it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly simple: you&amp;rsquo;ll have your first simulation running in under an hour.</description></item><item><title>2D Shapes</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-shapes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/fpga-shapes/</guid><description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In 2D Shapes, we build on what we learned from Lines and Triangles in two ways: drawing new shapes and learning to colour them in. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with rectangles and filled triangles before moving on to circles. These basic shapes make it possible to create a wide variety of graphics and user interfaces.

It&amp;rsquo;s time to turn our attention to drawing. Most modern computer graphics come down to drawing triangles and colouring them in. So, it seems fitting to begin our drawing tour with triangles and the straight lines that form them. This post will implement Bresenham&amp;rsquo;s line algorithm in Verilog and create lines, triangles, and even a cube (our first sort-of 3D).

Verilator is a Verilog simulator and C++ compiler that also supports linting: statically analysing your designs for issues. Not only can Verilator spot problems your synthesis tool might overlook, but it also runs quickly. Verilator is also great for graphics simulation with SDL.

In this post, I provide a quick guide to building an open-source FPGA toolchain for iCE40 boards, such as iCEBreaker. I plan to cover ECP5 FPGAs in a future version.
This guide is designed for Ubuntu or Pop!_OS 20.04, but should be straightforward to adjust to your own distro. These instructions will work on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), but there&amp;rsquo;s no USB support in WSL, so you can&amp;rsquo;t program boards under WSL.</description></item><item><title>Framebuffers</title><link>https://projectf.io/posts/framebuffers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://projectf.io/posts/framebuffers/</guid><description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the previous part, we worked with sprites, but another approach is needed as graphics become more complex. Instead of drawing directly to the screen, we draw to a framebuffer, which is read out to the screen. This post provides an introduction to framebuffers and how to scale them up. We&amp;rsquo;ll also learn how to fizzlefade graphics Wolfenstein 3D style.

In the previous part, we updated our display signals and learnt about colour palettes. This part shows you how to create fast, colourful graphics with minimal logic. Hardware sprites maintain much of the simplicity of our Pong design while offering greater creative freedom.
