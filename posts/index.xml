      <description>This FPGA demo effect renders four animated rasterbars. I created this effect with benjamin.computer for All You Need, a Chapterhouse prod released at Revision 2022.
For an introduction to rasterbars and other simple graphics effects, check out Racing the Beam.
The design was originally for a custom Artix-7 dev board, but this version runs on the Digilent Arty or as a Verilator/SDL simulation on your computer.

      <description>In this FPGA demo, we use multiple shapes (rectangles, triangles, circles) to render a simple picture of a castle. We don&amp;rsquo;t use any software or CPU, just shape rasterization and finite state machines. As our FPGA graphics capabilities improve, I&amp;rsquo;ll add more features to this drawing. Stay tuned.
The design runs on the Digilent Arty or as a Verilator/SDL simulation on your computer.

      <description>Welcome to my ongoing series covering mathematics and algorithms with FPGAs. This series begins with the basics of Verilog numbers, then considers fixed-point, division, square roots and CORDIC before covering more complex algorithms, such as data compression. This post was last updated in December 2022.
In this first post, we consider integers, dig into the challenges of signed numbers and expressions, and then finish with a bit of arithmetic.

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the final part of our introductory graphics series, we&amp;rsquo;re looking at animation. We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen animation with hardware sprites, but double buffering gives us maximum creative freedom with fast, tear-free motion. We&amp;rsquo;ll be making extensive use of our designs from 2D Shapes, so have a look back at that post if you need a refresher on drawing shapes.

      <guid>https://projectf.io/posts/spram-ice40-fpga/</guid>
      <description>The iCE40 UltraPlus distinguishes itself from the rest of the iCE40 FPGA family by including a relatively generous 1 Mb (128 KiB) of single port synchronous SRAM known as SPRAM. SPRAM blocks are much larger than BRAM but are limited to a single port and 16-bit data bus.
In this quick how to, we learn how to use SPRAM with Yosys and contrast it with Block RAM. If you want to learn more about other FPGA memory, see FPGA Memory Types.</description>

      <guid>https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-sim-verilator-sdl/</guid>
      <description>It can be challenging to test your FPGA or ASIC graphics designs. You can perform low-level behavioural simulations and examine waveforms, but you also need to verify how the video output will appear on the screen.
By combining Verilator and SDL, you can build Verilog simulations that let you see your design on your computer. The thought of creating a graphical simulation can be intimidating, but it&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly simple: you&amp;rsquo;ll have your first simulation running in under an hour.</description>

      <guid>https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-library-announcement/</guid>
      <description>I like to learn by doing, by trying things out and experimenting. However, this is hard with FPGAs; there’s a significant lack of practical Verilog designs online. The Project F Library is the latest part of my attempt to make things a little better for FPGA hackers and beginners. Over the last couple of years, I’ve built up a small collection of handy Verilog modules. The Library brings these modules together with documentation and test benches to make them more accessible.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In 2D Shapes, we build on what we learned from Lines and Triangles in two ways: drawing new shapes and learning to colour them in. We&amp;rsquo;ll start with rectangles and filled triangles before moving on to circles. These basic shapes make it possible to create a wide variety of graphics and user interfaces.

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. It&amp;rsquo;s time to turn our attention to drawing. Most modern computer graphics come down to drawing triangles and colouring them in. So, it seems fitting to begin our drawing tour with triangles and the straight lines that form them. This post will implement Bresenham&amp;rsquo;s line algorithm in Verilog and create lines, triangles, and even a cube (our first sort-of 3D).

      <guid>https://projectf.io/posts/verilog-lint-with-verilator/</guid>
      <description>Hardware design can be unforgiving, so it pays to use any advantage you can get. Verilator is a Verilog simulator and C++ compiler that also supports linting: statically analysing your designs for issues. Not only can Verilator spot problems your synthesis tool might overlook, but it also runs quickly. Verilator is also great for graphics simulation with SDL. This post was last updated in July 2021.

      <description>The square root is useful in many circumstances, including statistics, graphics, and signal processing. In this how to, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at a straightforward digit-by-digit square root algorithm for integer and fixed-point numbers. There are lower-latency methods, but this one is simple, using only subtraction and bit shifts. This post was last updated in June 2021.

      <description>Since I tested FPGA development tools on Ubuntu 20.04, there have been requests for more posts on FPGA tooling. In this post, I provide a quick guide to building an open-source FPGA toolchain for iCE40 boards, such as iCEBreaker. I plan to cover ECP5 FPGAs in a future version. This post was last updated in February 2022.
This guide is designed for Ubuntu or Pop!_OS 20.04, but should be straightforward to adjust to your own distro.</description>

      <description>This three-part tutorial provides a quick introduction to FPGA development with SystemVerilog and the Digilent Nexys Video board. No prior experience of FPGA development is required, but basic knowledge of programming concepts is assumed. If you can write a simple program with Python or JavaScript, you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have any trouble. This post was last updated in June 2021.
I find working with FPGAs gives me a sense of delight so often lacking in modern software development.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the previous part, we worked with sprites, but another approach is needed as graphics become more complex. Instead of drawing directly to the screen, we draw to a framebuffer, which is read out to the screen. This post provides an introduction to framebuffers and how to scale them up. We&amp;rsquo;ll also learn how to fizzlefade graphics Wolfenstein 3D style. This post was last updated in November 2022.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. In the previous part, we updated our display signals and learnt about colour palettes. This part shows you how to create fast, colourful graphics with minimal logic. Hardware sprites maintain much of the simplicity of our Pong design while offering greater creative freedom.
This post was completely revised in June 2022.
In this series, we learn about graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs.</description>

This demo uses an old framebuffer design. For new projects, I recommend Framebuffers.
Requirements For this demo you need an FPGA board with video output. I&amp;rsquo;ll be working with the Digilent Arty, but it should be easy to adapt this design to other boards.</description>

      <description>Designing with FPGAs involves many types of memory, some familiar from other devices, but some that are specific to FPGAs. This how to gives a quick overview of the different flavours, together with their strengths and weaknesses, and some sample designs. This guide includes external memory types, such as SRAM and HBM, that are used in CPUs and GPUs, so much of what is said here is generally applicable, but the focus is on FPGAs.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to Exploring FPGA Graphics. Last time, we raced the beam; this time, we&amp;rsquo;ll recreate the classic arcade Pong and play against our FPGA. This post was last updated in June 2022.
This post was completely revised in April 2022.
In this series, we learn about graphics at the hardware level and get a feel for the power of FPGAs. We&amp;rsquo;ll learn how screens work, play Pong, create starfields and sprites, paint Michelangelo&amp;rsquo;s David, draw lines and triangles, and animate characters and shapes.</description>

      <description>Division is a fundamental arithmetic operation; one we take for granted in most contexts. FPGAs are different; Verilog can&amp;rsquo;t synthesize division: we need to do it ourselves. In this how to, we&amp;rsquo;re going to look at a straightforward division algorithm for positive integers and fixed-point numbers. For integers, this method takes one cycle per bit: 32 cycles for 32-bit numbers. This post was last updated June 2021.

      <title>Video Timings: VGA, SVGA, 720p, 1080p</title>

      <guid>https://projectf.io/posts/video-timings-vga-720p-1080p/</guid>
      <description>To work with standard monitors and TVs, you need to use the correct video timings. This how to includes the timings for four standard display modes using analogue VGA, DVI, HDMI, or DisplayPort: 640x480 (VGA), 800x600 (SVGA), 1280x720, and 1920x1080 all at 60 Hz.
CRT monitors typically support higher refresh rates in addition to 60 Hz, such as 72 and 85 Hz, but most LCD monitors do not. There are an increasing number of televisions and monitors that do support high refresh rates, but these are beyond the scope of this guide.</description>

      <description>These demos combine some of my earliest FPGA designs from 2018: simple sprites and an animated starfield generated with a linear-feedback shift register. I don&amp;rsquo;t recommend using this approach to sprites in new designs, check out the hardware sprites tutorial instead. This post was last updated in August 2022.

      <title>Fixed Point Numbers in Verilog</title>

      <guid>https://projectf.io/posts/fixed-point-numbers-in-verilog/</guid>
      <description>Sometimes you need more precision than integers can provide, but floating-point computation is not trivial (try reading IEEE 754). You could use a library or IP block, but simple fixed point maths can often get the job done with little effort. Furthermore, most FPGAs have dedicated DSP blocks that make multiplication and addition of integers fast; we can take advantage of that with a fixed-point approach.

      <description>Welcome back to our three-part FPGA tutorial with SystemVerilog and the Digilent Arty A7. In part two, we&amp;rsquo;re going to learn about clocks and counting. Along the way, we&amp;rsquo;ll cover maintaining state with flip-flops, timing things with clock dividers, creating our first Verilog module, and controlling LEDs with pulse width modulation. You might be surprised how far counting takes you: by the end of this tutorial, you&amp;rsquo;ll be creating RGB lighting effects worthy of a cheesy gaming PC.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s common for a simulation or firmware to need data loading into a memory array, ram, or rom. Fortunately, Verilog provides the $readmemh and $readmemb functions for this very purpose. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of good Verilog documentation online, so using them can be harder than it should be. This how to explains the syntax and provides plenty of examples, including how to do this in Yosys and Xilinx Vivado.</description>

      <description>In this post, I test common FPGA tools for compatibility with Ubuntu 20.04 (AKA Focal Fossa), and my regular desktop OS: Pop!_OS 20.04. These tests are in no way exhaustive: I have tried using the applications as I usually do to exercise the main functionality. I have also included instructions for building the tools from source when available. This is my final update for this post (July 2020).
Tested: IceStorm Tools, nextpnr, nMigen, Verilator, Vivado, Yosys Incomplete: Quartus Get in touch: GitHub Issues, 1BitSquared Discord, @WillFlux (Mastodon), @WillFlux (Twitter)</description>
